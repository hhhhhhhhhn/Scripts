# Scripts

This repo contains shell scripts. Most of them will only work in bash without
any modifications. Also, some of my scripts use my other tools, like mmd and
mmenu, and need them to work to varying extent.

## List

- catcat: Completely useless
- color COLOSCHEME: Sets linux tty colorschemes with easy to read files.
  Read the comments in the beggining to read more. Probably the most usefull
  script in the repo.
- flip: Flips a coin.
- font: Sets tty font size, needs tamsyn font.
- note [NOTEPAD]: Take a timestampled markdown note, see my bbn repo for more
  info.
- record: Opens up mtm, and records with asciinema and arecord.
- roll [AMOUNT]: Rolls and displays dice.
- todo [TEXT...]: If text is given, adds it to todo list. Else, displays it.
- view [NOTEPAD]: Displays an entire notepad.
- wr: Opens up your editor for writing markdown, and copies it as html. Needs
  pandoc.
- wtconverter FILE: Converts a Windows Terminal theme to one compatible with
  the "color" script.
